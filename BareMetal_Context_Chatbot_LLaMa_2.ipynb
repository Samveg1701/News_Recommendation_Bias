Bund cropping on samba paddy fields is an effective measure to control pest attack.

Periyar-Vaigai Irrigation Ayacut Farmers Associations secretary K Thirupathy said the hundred-day work scheme was implemented to help people overcome drought situations, when there was no agricultural activity. ``But they were instead made to do alternate work and paid for it. Now, as it is implemented during the agricultural seasons also, it is causing much hardships,’’ he said. There should be a balance on how the labour is utilized. Earlier, all of them were employed in agriculture, but as the 100-day work scheme is offering less work and more pay, all workers have moved out of agriculture, he said. Thirupathy said that government should ensure there are workers in fields when there is agricultural activity. Cultivation and weeding can only be done manually.

The biofloc exhibition unit has been established in the district at a cost of Rs 7.5 lakh. Himanshu Khurana, chief development officer (CDO) of the district, said, “Applying the biofloc technology, farmers can raise fish in artificial tanks in an area between 150-to-200 square metres. These tanks are connected with piped water supply. The system can be used to produce freshwater fish species such as tilapia, pangasius, common carp, and others. Organic waste in the tanks will be treated and converted into fish food by using helpful bacteria and carbon sources like molasses.” The official added that the scheme will boost employment.

Even as state units and the Indian Youth Congress kicked off street protests against the bills, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi alleged the Modi government and the prime minister himself were “misleading” people on the provisions of the bills, which he said would leave Indian farmers at the mercy of corporate players. “In India, the average size of farmholding is 2 acres, and they account for over 80% of the total farmers in the country. For the government to claim that farmers with such limited means will be able to bargain and negotiate with corporate players on an equal footing is ridiculous,” Singhvi said. Citing the example of Bihar, which abolished the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act in 2006, Singhvi said the result was significantly lesser government procurement of farm produce and also the winding up of mandis.

Farmers’ organisations have been demanding that the government should clear the dues from the exchequer without waiting for the sale of sugar stocks or measures to be initiated under Revenue Recovery Act. Across the country, sugar mills are struggling to manage the situation due to high production cost and low MSP. While the mills were made to buy sugarcane from farmers at fair and remunerative price, the government’s minimum support price (MSP) is not matching their production cost. \\n\\nQuestion: Generate a headline for the article provided.

Subsequently, nearly 10 to 12 farmers sold up to 50 cents each to the CRPF after getting a written agreement on December 5, 1994, that they would be allowed to use the road to drive tractors and other heavy vehicles to their lands for farming purposes.” Farmers said they had no issues until 2019, when the college management laid a fresh road and closed it from both the sides. “We could walk and ride two-wheelers, but can’t drive small vans and tractors.

The market had shut its operations for three days from auctions for three days from May 26 to May 28 after a worker at the APMC tested positive for Covid-19.

Around 500 tonne of the produce is exported to Mumbai every day from Nashik in nearly 150 vehicles. Apart from traders, farmer groups also directly supply vegetables to the state capital.

The protests have been ongoing since 2020, with the latest one being held on March 24, 2021, in which farmers and workers held a protest march in the city against the controversial farm laws. The protests have been marked by intense police repression, with many protesters being detained or arrested. Despite this, the protests have continued to grow in size and intensity, with many farmers' organizations and political parties lending their support to the cause.

According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), there has been a fivefold rise in farmer protests since 2017. The report also revealed that the protests have been peaceful, with no major incidents of violence or vandalism. Despite the government's repeated assurances to repeal the laws, farmers are determined to continue their protests until their demands are met. As the protests enter their fifth month, farmers are now planning to intensify their agitation by organizing more rallies and demonstrations across the country. With the winter months approaching, the protests are likely to gain more steam, and the government will have to take concrete steps to address the farmers' concerns.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The farmers' protests have been gaining momentum across the country, with thousands of farmers and agricultural workers taking to the streets to demand the repeal of the new farm laws.
