This year, if the low temperatures sustain for much longer, it could hamper the flowering in mango trees which is supposed to happen around this time. R Srinivasa Rao, deputy director of horticulture, Vizianagaram said, “The problem is not so much with the cold weather, but with mango hoppers (a pest) which thrive in cold weather conditions and cause a drop in flowering.” Assistant director of horticulture K Sailaja said, “The flowering happens during winter.

The HVDS has helped the state power utility in cutting down cases of power theft as the scheme curbs illegal tapping of power and helped the farmers in getting uninterrupted power supply. The conventional low tension lines have transformers at some places from where 25 farmers are given connections. But in the HVDS, power can only be drawn after it goes through the transformer dedicated for maximum two farmers at one time. In conventional power supply lines that would run for several kilometers, stealing of electricity also led to constant burning down of transformers.

       "  'NASHIK: The Maharashtra state onion growers’ association (MSOGA) has urged the Union and state governments to procure onions directly from farmers at Rs 2,000 per quintal. Their demand comes against the backdrop of the onion auctions stopping in most agriculture producers market committees (APMCs) and the wholesale rates dropping to Rs 500-650 per quintal. According to the association, it costs more than Rs 1,000 to grow each quintal of onion and farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. “Onion auctions in most of the APMCs, including Lasalgaon, have been stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The average wholesale price has also dropped to Rs 550 per quintal. Farmers are making heavy losses,” confirmed Bharat Dighole, the MSOGA president. The National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) has also started procuring onions in the district, but it is procuring onions at the market rate. Nafed is buying onions to create a buffer stock for the Centre with target of 50,000 tonne. Of which, 40,000 tonne are to be procured in different markets in Maharashtra and remaining 10,000 tonne from Gujarat. “We want the Centre to increase Nafed’s onion procu'),\n",

       "  'Vadodara: At a time when the farmers are forced to sell their produce at lower prices due to the coronavirus pandemic, a farmer in Chhota Udepur district has been minting money by growing two new breeds of watermelons. Prakash Rathwa, a watermelon farmer in Segvasimli village in Pavi Jetpur taluka, harvested around 80 tons of these new fruits when the lockdown was implemented. But he has sold around 90% of his produce by the time the extended lockdown is coming to an end and has also tripled his income. What helped Rathwa was also the curiosity amongst buyers about the fruit. One type of fruit is yellow inside instead of red and the other type retains the red colour inside but is yellow outside. “The yellow pulped watermelon is 16 to 18% sweeter than the watermelons which are currently available in the market and the yellow skinned watermelons are 14 to 15% sweeter,” said Rathwa. He has grown the fruit on eight bighas of his land. As the quality of this fruit is different, Rathwa has been able to sell them at Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kilogram instead of Rs 15 which the other watermelon would fetch him. He had spent Rs 2 lakh during the sowing season, but he has already earned an income o'),\n",

       "  'KOLHAPUR : As the agricultural produce markets remain closed due to the extension of the lockdown in big cities, especially Pune and Mumbai which fall in the red zones, the fruits and vegetables grown by the farmers in the fields are likely to go down the drain. Pranav Patil, a farmer from Shirol who supplies exotic flowers and vegetables to big cities, did not harvest the produce in his poly house (commonly known as green house) with the hope that the lockdown would be lifted and the markets would reopen. “Due to the floods last year, flowers like gerbera and carnation, which I had grown in the poly house, went in waste. This time, I decided to grow vegetables. I procured the top quality seeds for growing yellow and red capsicum. Now, that the markets are closed, I will again lose my crop. I will not be able to repay the loan that I had taken to set up the poly house,” said Patil. There are over 900 poly houses in the district. With proper nutrition and under regulated temperature, farmers grow exotic flowers and vegetables in the poly houses organically, which, despite being costly, have a huge demand from hotels in big cities.

       "  'Guntur: The Federation of All India Farmers Associations ( FAIFA ) has appealed to the Union government to protect livelihoods of tobacco growers during the ongoing pandemic as demand for tobacco products has fallen in the wake of the lockdown. Flue cured virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers are under stress to sell their harvest and meet mounting labour and infrastructure charges due to interruption of auctions following the lockdown. Nearly 130 million kilograms of FCV tobacco worth over Rs 2,000 crore are yet to be sold with tobacco auctions resuming only gradually, causing quality loss under prolonged storage. Auctions for the winter FCV cultivation usually start in March. In 2019, farmers received an average price of Rs 121.53 per kg for the crop grown in the state. This year, demand from traders and manufacturers has been weak due to rising inventory in the market and delay in export shipments. ` With over 95% of the crop in storage, FCV tobacco farmers in the state fear losses of more than Rs 200 crores on account of quality deterioration and weight loss. “We request the Union government to immediately start the auctions in all the auction platforms.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao issued a statement on Tuesday saying the change would begin with paddy which will be limited to 50 lakh acres. Redgram, another important crop, will be limited to 10 lakh acres. The government will soon announce what crops should be cultivated in which areas. Officials said the state government will not extend Rythu Bandhu scheme and Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers who don’t follow the new directives. At present the state gives Rs 10,000 per acre per year to each farmer whether he cultivates the land or not. The statement said regulatory cultivation would benefit farmers as it would help get minimum support price and ensure demand for their produce. To convey this message KCR will interact with field officials on May 15. The state would also set up a seed regulatory authority to check spurious seeds in the state.
